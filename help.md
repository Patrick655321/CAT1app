# How to use RosterRight

The purpose of RosterRight is to allow the user to create and manipulate a simple roster for a cafe/bar. Shifts are spereated into days and divided but day/night then within these divided further into the role which will be required (bar, restaurant, manager). Staff details can be stored and there is an ability to create an external roster file for the purposes of printing/emailing information to other users.

### Installation:

To use RosterRight you will need to have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

You will need to create a clone of the [github repository](https://github.com/Patrick655321/CAT1app).
To do this simply create an empty directory in which you would like the program stored, change in to that directory and then type:
```
git clone git@github.com:Patrick655321/CAT1app.git
```
After this it is a simple matter of changing into the
```
CAT1app
```
directory created by the clone and then typing
```
open_rr.sh
```
